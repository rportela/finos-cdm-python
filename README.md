# Common Domain Model

The Common Domain Model (CDM) is a standardized, machine-readable, and machine-executable data and process model for how financial products are traded and managed across the transaction lifecycle.

The CDM is based on cross-industry collaboration between ICMA, ISDA, and ISLA and facilitates trade processing of repo, securities lending, bond, and derivatives transactions. The CDM is available in FINOS under the FINOS Community Specification License 1.0
